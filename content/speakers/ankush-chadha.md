I am passionate about Open source and community projects. I currently manage a team at JFrog that if focussed on open source and community projects such as gocenter.io. I have given a few lightning talks at GopherCon SanDiego 2019 and Helm Summit 2018. I love sharing best practices and given a lot of meetups in Sunnyvale (US) and Bengaluru (India).
